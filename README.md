# BandikaSwiftBase

This library contains common classes of SwiftyBandika and SwiftyBandikaCL.

SwiftyBandika is a CMS server app on the Apple App Store (thus including a frontend).

SwiftyBandikaCL is the headless (Command Line based) server.

This library is based on SwiftNIO with NIOHTTP1

It uses its own Request and Response classes as well as an own template type which is more request orientated (so not quite as dumb) compared to other template types.
